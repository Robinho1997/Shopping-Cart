# Shopping-Cart

https://robinho1997.github.io/Shopping-Cart/

The user can add/remove Items from a Shopping Cart.
The price and number of the items is visually updated so the user always knows how much is in his basket and what the cost of his purchase would be.
Its possible to clear the whole cart or remove items independently.
